Learning and Understanding **"Design Patterns"** with Theory and Coding Demonstration.

 Design Patterns: Gang of four created design patterns to implement code efficiently.

 There are main 3 types of design pattern categories:
**1. Creational Design Pattern:**
      Creation type deals with object creation and initialization.
    1. Singleton Design Pattern
    2. Factory Design Pattern

    This type deals with class and object composition. This pattern mainly focuses on decoupling interfaces and
    implementation of classes and it's objects
    1. Adapter Design Pattern
    2. Bridge Design Pattern
